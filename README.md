# Game_Mouse_In_Maze
Joystick for touchscreen. And I made it modular so in future more games can be easily added. 


Modular platform so more games can be easily added.

Control mouse by click and drag or with joystick for touchscreens.

Maze will resize in respond to screensize. Number of cheeses will adjust too. (1 or 3)

I used the maze algoritm from my previous project Maze_Generator.
